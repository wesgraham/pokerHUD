## Project Status
This is meant to be an academic project. There is very little development occuring for this project presently. This is due to hurdles encountered in bot policy on most active poker sites. I will continue to maintain this repository by thoroughly reviewing any open source contributions. I will provide support and guidance for anyone looking to continue development. 

## What is PokerHUD?
PokerHUD is a poker heads up display (HUD). The HUD allows poker players to enter hand data on their opponents, and displays vital statistics such as **VPiP** (% of hands with funds voluntarily put in pot), **PFR** (Pre-flop aggressor rate), and **average bet siz**e. These metrics can be used to analyze a player's aggression and playing habits. 

PokerHUD consists of a Postgres instance, a set of Go functions, and a MVP front end.
